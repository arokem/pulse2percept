<h3>What would the world look like to someone with a bionic eye?</h3>

<p> More than 20 million Americans aged 18 and older have experienced vision
loss, according to the <a
href="http://www.afb.org/info/blindness-statistics/adults/facts-and-figures/235">American
Foundation for the Blind</a>], and the rates of vision loss are expected to
double by 2030 as the nation’s population ages. A variety of sight recovery
therapies are being developed by companies around the world, offering new hope
for people who are blind. But little is known about what the world will look
like to patients who undergo such procedures. </p> <p> We have developed a
computer model of what someone with restored vision might see. This computer
model creates a ‘virtual patient’ who can give scientists and patients into the
vision that these prostheses might provide. </p> The following videos show a
simulation of the vision of a patient implanted with an electronic prosthesis
like the <a
href="http://www.secondsight.com/g-the-argus-ii-prosthesis-system-pf-en.html">Argus
II </a>The Argus II bionic eye system is the major electrical prosthesis
device on the market. It uses a digital camera mounted to a pair of eyeglasses
that sends visual data to a computer chip implanted on the side of the eye. This
chip then activates a small array of electrodes implanted in the retina that
stimulates retinal cells to convert that data into vision.
